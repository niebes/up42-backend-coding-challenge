# Contributing

## Pull requests only

- **DON'T** push to the master branch directly. Always use feature branches and let people discuss changes in pull requests.
- Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been concluded and at least 1 reviewer has given their **approval**.
You may approve the Pull Request or your pairing partner as long as the PR creator and approver are two different person.

## Guidelines

- **every change** needs a test
- keep the current code style (check .editorconf)
 

### Nitpicking

Nitpicking is when a reviewer identifies trivial and unimportant details in a pull request and asks the author to change them. 
This is a completely subjective category that is impossible to define universally, and itâ€™s equally impractical to define a blanket policy on nitpicking that everyone will be happy with.

Reviewers should feel comfortable giving any feedback they have on a pull request regardless of how trivial it is. 
Authors should feel equally comfortable passing on feedback that they think is trivial and inconsequential.

Often, reviewers have an opinion about whether the feedback they are about to give is a nitpick or not. 
While not required, it can be really helpful to identify that feedback as such, for example "nit: a newline after this would be helpful". 
This helps the author understand your intention.
